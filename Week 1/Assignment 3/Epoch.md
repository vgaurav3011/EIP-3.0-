## Epoch

The input data is divided into two components in general: <br/>

1. Training Data <br/>

2. Test Data <br/>

   <br/>

   The neural network is first ran on the training data and then its accuracy and precision are checked on the test data which finally accounts for the feasibility of the network.<br/>

   Epoch is a concept referring to a traversal of one full pass of the training dataset by the neural network. It is generally iterative as the model improves with higher number of epochs because it helps the neural network identify more patterns. <br/>

   A single epoch involves:<br/>

   1. Forward propagation of the neural network

   2. Backward propagation of the neural network<br/>

      The idea is to correctly fit the data and thus too many epochs may lead to overfitting of the data while very few number of epochs may lead to underfitting of the data. <br/>
