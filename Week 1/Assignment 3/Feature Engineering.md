## Feature Engineering:

It is one of the important processes involved in prediction problems where the main aim is to obtain the result and compare the accuracies of the results obtained after different processes or models experimented on the input data. </br>

The process of obtaining a dataset and construction of features which can be used as a training of the learning model to make a solution to a prediction problem. The traditional method of feature engineering is full of duplicate effort, time consuming and vulnerable to errors. This method is highly dependent on the problems and needs to be re-written for each new dataset.

It is carried out by data scientists and analysts without technical background where they research manually different parameters affecting the results, identify patterns through data exploration and also research a potential solution to the problem by making new techniques on relevant features which can affect the data.
