## Feature Maps:

The result of the convolution operation is called a feature map.</br>

At every point on the feature map, the value is obtained by performing matrix multiplication and sum up the results of the convolution into a single cell and all such cells together form a new matrix called a feature map. The area of the field used for multiplication is also called as receptive fields. In the given example, the green area of the matrix is called the receptive field and the final matrix obtained is called the feature map.
