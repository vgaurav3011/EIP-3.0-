## Feature Maps:

The result of the convolution operation is called a feature map.</br>

At every point on the feature map, the value is obtained by performing matrix multiplication and sum up the results of the convolution into a single cell and all such cells together form a new matrix called a feature map. The area of the field used for multiplication is also called as receptive fields. In the given example, the green area of the matrix is called the receptive field and the final matrix obtained is called the feature map. <br/>
The main characteristic of a feature map is that it is the result of filtering the input data and contains only those loud features or desirable qualities which are to be used further in a neural network.
