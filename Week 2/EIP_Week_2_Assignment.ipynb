        "\n",
        "* **Input layer with two inputs neurons**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **One hidden layer with two neurons**\n",

        "\n",
        "## Weights, weights, weights\n",
        "Neural network training is about finding weights that minimize prediction error. We usually start our training with a set of randomly generated weights.Then, backpropagation is used to update the weights in an attempt to correctly map arbitrary inputs to outputs.\n",
        "\n",

        "* **`w1 = 0.70`**,\n",
        "* **`w2 = 0.71`**,\n",

        "Our main goal of the training is to reduce the error or the difference between prediction and actual output. Since actual output is constant, “not changing”, the only way to reduce the error is to change prediction value. The question now is, how to change prediction value?\n",

        "## Backpropagation\n",
        "Backpropagation, short for “backward propagation of errors”, is a mechanism used to update the weights using gradient descent. It calculates the gradient of the error function with respect to the neural network’s weights. The calculation proceeds backwards through the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function; in our case we want to minimize th error function. To find a local minimum of a function using gradient descent, one takes steps proportional to the negative of the gradient of the function at the current point.\n",

        "\n",
        "For example, to update w6, we take the current w6 and subtract the partial derivative of error function with respect to w6. Optionally, we multiply the derivative of the error function by a selected number to make sure that the new updated weight is minimizing the error function; this number is called learning rate.\n",
